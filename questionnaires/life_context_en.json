For breakfast, I typically have toast and coffee while organizing my tasks for the day. I leave home around 8 AM and take the subway to work, during which I listen to podcasts or read the news. I arrive at the office and start work at 9 AM. At noon, I have lunch with colleagues at a nearby restaurant. In the afternoon, I alternate between meetings and project work, then leave the office around 6 PM. I get home around 7 PM, take a quick shower, and prepare dinner. While eating dinner, I watch YouTube or Netflix. From 9 PM to 11 PM, I engage in personal study or hobbies. Before bed, I read for about 30 minutes and go to sleep around midnight."

On weekend mornings, I make things I don't usually eat during the week, like pancakes or eggs benedict, while playing my favorite music. In the morning, I catch up on household chores or do laundry. Around 11 AM, I head to the gym for a workout. After exercising for about an hour, I come home and shower, then around 2 PM, I either meet friends or spend personal time at a café. When meeting friends, we usually explore new restaurants or watch movies. Around 6 PM, I return home for a simple dinner, then binge-watch series I've missed or play video games. On Sunday evening, I prepare for the coming week by planning my schedule and organizing necessary items. On weekends, I go to bed a bit later than weekdays, around 1 AM."
